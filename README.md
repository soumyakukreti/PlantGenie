# PlantGenie

PlantGenie is a comprehensive web application designed for plant enthusiasts and gardeners. 
It leverages the power of Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, providing a seamless experience for users to interact with their garden data, receive plant care advice, and utilize image recognition for plant disease detection.

## Features

- **Garden Management**: Users can add, view, and manage their garden's plants through an intuitive interface.
- **Chatbot**: A chatbot is available for users to ask questions related to plant care and receive instant advice.
- **Image Recognition**: Users can upload images of their plants to detect potential diseases and receive suggestions for treatment. Yolov8 models are utilized for this purpose
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Python 3.9 or higher
- MongoDB

### Installation
